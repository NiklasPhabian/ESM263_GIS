## Assignment 3: Evaluation Rubric

Rubrics for this course are cumulative; that is, **the general warnings and suggestions** (but not the specific point values) **in the rubrics for the previous assignments**:

- [assignment 1 rubric](../01/rubric.md)
- [assignment 2 rubric](../02/rubric.md)

**remain in effect**.

Here are some *additional* specific problem areas in Assignment 3 that we'll be paying attention to:

### Model

- Don't leave disconnected tools or inputs in your model—everything in your model should be on a connected path to the final output.
- Make sure that tools that use the same input dataset refer to it using the model input parameter.

### Map

#### Layout

- Give your map enough visual context (e.g. basemap information) that it's intelligible, but not so much that the context overwhelms the data.
- If your map includes linear features like roads or rivers, don't let other features cover them up—it makes it look like the linear features are interrupted.

#### Symbology

- Be sure to indicate and rank the top 10 sites.
- Use a color scheme doesn't inappropriately highlight lower ranked sites.
- Use a color scheme that distinguishes sites even if they're not labeled.

#### Legend

- Be sure to specify the ranking criterion.

### Data

- Be sure to hand in the correct dataset. Read the instructions carefully!
