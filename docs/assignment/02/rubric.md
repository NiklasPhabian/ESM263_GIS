## Assignment 2: Evaluation Rubric
**CONTENTS**

- TOC
{:toc}
This assignment doesn't have a specific "this many points off for that mistake" rubric. However, here are some of the problem areas we'll be paying attention to:

### Overall

- Any **text** (title, legend, sources, etc.) on your map should be correct (i.e., telling the truth), grammatical, and free of typos.
- Map components' prominence should be proportional to their information content.
    - Your legend, title, and (if present) locator map should neither be too small to read/interpret, nor so large that they overwhelm the main map.
- Use the layout's space wisely. Your map should be neither too cluttered nor too empty.
- Your map should have Goldilocks margins: not too big, not too small, but just right...
- Your map's scale should be large enough that the primary data are clearly visible.
- Define any acronyms the first time you use them.
    - Especially: don't use an undefined acronym in the map's title, unless it is part of everyday English (e.g., USA).

### Symbology

- Your color scheme should clearly distinguish land vs water.
- Your map's background colors should be distinct from, and significantly less obtrusive than, the colors used to symbolize your data.
- Consider using transparency to distinguish overlapping layers.

### Legend

- The legend should identify all visible map distinctions.
- Units displayed in the legend should be appropriate and correct.
- The legend's labels should be clear and relevant to your map's main message.
    - e.g., "sea level rise", not "elevation"

### Scale bar

- Include a scale bar if the map's scale is large enough that the scale is reasonably constant at all locations and in all directions.
- Make sure the scale bar indicates the scale of the **data** frame.
- Scale bar units and divisions should be selected for ease of human interpretation.
    - E.g., use "round" numbers: multiples or powers of 10, etc.

### Locator map

- Include a locator map if the map frame's extent is not obvious to its intended audience.
- A locator map should have an extent indicator.

### Source information

- Provide source information for all layers displayed, and any undisplayed layers that were used to calculate displayed information.
- Source information should contain dates for any time-sensitive layers.
- A layer's "publisher" is the entity that provided the data to you (e.g. ESRI), vs the entity that complied the data (e.g., USGS).
    - For data provided directly to you by the ESM 263 class, you may either omit the publisher, or use "ESM 263".

### Data table

- The data table must be present and correct.
- Suppress spurious precision (e.g. trailing zeroes) in displayed numeric data.

### Submission mechanics

- Your map image should be exported at the correct size and resolution.
- Any files you submit should follow the specified naming convention **exactly**.
