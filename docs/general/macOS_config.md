## Configuring your system (macOS)

When working with QGIS, you need to have a few tweaks applied to your macOS environment.

You should only have to do these once.

### Configure Finder

Many GIS data formats use multiple files that share the same name, differing only in the extension. If you can't see the extension, managing these files can get really confusing really quickly. We'll make sure *Finder* always shows us a file's extension.

1. Open *Finder*
1. Click *Finderâ†’Preferences...*
1. Click *Advanced*
1. **Check** *Show all filename extensions*
