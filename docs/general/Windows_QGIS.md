## Installing QGIS (Windows)

> NOTE: For a Bren (as opposed to your own) computer, skip to step 5.

1. **If you already have an older version of QGIS installed, un-install it.**
1. Download [`QGIS-3.22.2.msi`](https://ucsb.box.com/s/i139n9khcrgidgjsmz6f5bilgvfmat04)
1. Double-click `QGIS-3.22.2.msi`
1. Click *OK*, or *Yes*, or whatever's the default, in all dialog boxes.
1. Right-click on *Startâ†’Programsâ†’QGIS 3.22.2â†’QGIS Desktop 3.22.2*
   - If you're using *Open-Shell*, select *Pin to Start menu (Open-Shell)*
   - else, select *Pin to Start*

Whew! *That* was complicatedâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰
