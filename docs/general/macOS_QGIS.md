## Installing QGIS (macOS)

1. Download [`QGIS-3.22.2.dmg`](https://ucsb.box.com/s/uisnoqytfftdqesacf3f97kldyonbdd0)
2. Double-click `QGIS-3.22.2.dmg`
3. Drag *QGIS* to your *Applications* folder
4. Double-click on *QGIS* to start it.
   - If you get a security warning, and *QGIS* won't start, try **right**-clicking on *QGIS* and then clicking *Open*. (You'll only need to do this once; thereafter, *QGIS* will start normally.)

5. Drag *QGIS* from your *Applications* folder onto your Dock (so you won't have to go hunting for it.)

Whew! *That* was complicatedâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰
